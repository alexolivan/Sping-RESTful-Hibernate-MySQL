A very basic (vanilla as possible, and following IOC java guidelines as much as
possible in project structure), starting point, or reference project for a java 
web based backend, featuring:<br>

- Spring Framework RESTful JSON web application<br>
- Hibernate for JPA persistence<br>
- MySQL as configured database<br>
- Spring security using Database stored user credentials and roles<br>

It consists two classes: User (authentication) and Role (authorization)<br>
It features separated packaging for domain, controller, service, repository and
their implementations.<br>
It allows basic CRUD operations on User class.<br>
It enforces basic HTTP authentication on paths defined on security XML config.<br>
It also allows to get authenticated user details on Spring Controler/Services/Repo if needed 
to further fine-grained filtering.<br>

It uses JSON on body to retrieve/send data.<br>


REST Endpoints are:<br>

GET /users -> get a list of all users<br>
GET /users/{username} -> get some user by its username<br>
POST /users/create -> add a new user (id is autogenerated)<br>
POST /users/update/{id} -> updates user by id<br>
DELETE /users/delte/{id} -> deletes user by {id}<br>


Note on libraries:<br>
When deploying into glassfish 4.1, I needed to manually replace libraries 
by those newer ones bellow:<br>

jboss-logging-3.3.0.Final.jar<br>
jackson-annotations-2.6.3.jar<br>  
jackson-core-2.6.3.jar<br>  
jackson-databind-2.6.3.jar<br>
jackson-jaxrs-base-2.6.3.jar<br>
jackson-jaxrs-json-provider-2.6.3.jar<br>

Note on glassfish:<br>
Ensure to create and configure a JDBC connection pool and resources on glassfish
Admin panel. Then update project config file to point to that connection.<br>
Some help images in resources folder.<br>

Note on MySQL:<br>
NO Hibernate auto database initialization in features in place... so, creating 
db, table, and updating annotations on java domain class acordingly is 
required.<br>
An example init.sql file for help is also included.<br>
